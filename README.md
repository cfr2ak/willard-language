Experimental Quantum Programming Language

## Signature
![Signature of the cat F.D.C. Willard](sig.png)

## Concepts
I'm quite convince that any quantum programming language should be implemented in a functional way.
THis leads me to implement this language to use function only. Even a qubit or a qbyte is a function in Willard.

### Video that I got my inspire
#### Youtube 
##### Lambda Calculus: PyCon 2019 Tutorial (Screencast)

### The core concepts
___What if the function is the only thing is the universe?___

- No packages/modules
- No objects
- No numbers
- No strings
- No Datatypes


## Compile flow
This compiler is made with Go programming language and transcript *.wld file into the OpenQASM language to execute on the IBM cloud.
